                            Onyenso Uchenna Joseph was born in Aba, Abia State, on 23rd September, 1999.
                            He is the son of Joseph Onyenso Sr. and Ogechi Onyenso. He has three senior brothers, Chika, Ifeanyi
                            and Osinachi, in order of birth. His family is Catholic and attends St. Finbarrs Parish in Umuahia.
                        </p>
                        <p class="story">
                            At 11, he enrolled in Master's Vessel Classical Academy (MVCA), but did not complete
                            high school there. He went on to school at <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_College_Umuahia">
                            Government College Umuahia</a>, where he was chosen to head the school as a School Captain (equivalent to a Senior
                            Prefect). During his tenure as School Captain, he was suspended by the school management alongside his entire administration,
                            being the first School Captain to be suspended while in office in the history of the school. The reason was that he
                            relieved his entire administration of their duties in protest of the level of disrespect the school management accorded them.
                            Before his position as a School Captain, he served as the college Regulator and an SRC (Students Representative Council)
                            representative for SS1 constituency. Onyenso was often described as different, sometimes an "outlaw" or a jonker (a Government
                            College Umuahia slang for someone who intentionally misses school activities, especially classes), by teachers and
                            students alike because he preferred studying on his own to going for classes to learn. To Onyenso, the school educational system was poor
                            and inadequate for him to achieve his life goals. He graduated from GCU in 2016, in which year the school held its first
                            official graduation ceremony, organized and spearheaded by his administration.

                        <P class="story">
                            After clearing his senior secondary school exams in 2016 (246 in JAMB and 7 distinctions, 2 credits in WAEC), Onyenso
                            gained admission into <a href="https://mouau.edu.ng/" target="blank">Michael Okpara University
                            of Agriculture Umudike</a> to study Electrical Engineering and Electronics. Currently, he is undergoing an unofficial internship at

                        <p class="story">
                            In JSS2 (2012), while on vacation at his uncle's house, Onyenso saw an advert on televison about <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_900">Nokia's Lumia 900</a>.
                            This incident sparked actions and decisions that would change his life forever.
                            He got curious about how the phone was able to accept input via a screen. How was the phone able
                            to run Windows which was familiar for PCs? So many questions were raised in his mind about how
                            phones worked. Due to this, he decided to study Computer Engineering and Electronics Engineering
                            because phones after all were computers, also they were electronics. This, he knew, would explain
                            the mystery behind the operations of phones. He went on to read articles about Windows and Microsoft.
                            Since then till date, he has been heavily influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates" target="blank">Bill Gates</a>.
                            Not because of Gates net worth, but because he was able to write a computer program at 13 and start Microsoft at 19.
                            Since then, Onyenso put it among his life goals to own a computer-related company which he gave a name, Routebird Engineering Enterprise&reg;,
                            and be like Gates.
                        </p>
                        <p class="story">
                            In the long vacation of 2013, Onyenso registered for training in computer hardware repairs at Trace Dynamics by his mum's decision.
                            He wanted to do something exceptional like Gates did at 13. And so before going back to school, Onyenso was able to decouple and couple
                            a laptop completely. At this point, he could already feel his future playing out.
                        </p>
                        <p class="story">
                            Against his wish, Onyenso got into <a href="https://mouau.edu.ng/" target="blank">Michael Okpara University
                            of Agriculture Umudike</a> and is studying Electrical Engineering and Electronics. This descision was also influenced by his mother
                            who wanted him close to be monitored.
                        </p>
                        <p class="story">
                            During the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown across the globe, Onyenso fell in love with programming. He learned languages like C, C++,
                            Python, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. He is also undergoing training in Mobile App and Web Development which he knows, will pave his
                            way to starting his long-awaited company.

                                Onyenso started a relationship with Ihendinihu Ezinne Pamela in July 2018. Before then, he had been in different relationships
                                that are not talked about here. In secondary school, he began playing chess and table tennis, although in recent times he has
                                turned rusty in both. Onyenso often describes his family life as annoying for reasons of misinterpretation of his actions
                                at different stages of his life since secondary school till date.

                    <p>In Onyenso's own words, <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">"Despite my course, Electrical Engineering and Electronics, I developed keen interest in Mobile App and Web Development.
                       This interest grew into a passion, almost an obsession. I decided to take lessons in Computer Programming from Harvard
                       University and Microsoft for which I’m certified for the few I’m done with.</p>

                    <p>I grew up in a region where access to technology is relatively not common. To have state-of-the-art
                       software or hardware is expensive. One of my goals is to be a Software Developer, where my
                       software will be efficient and affordable to people who might not have the means.</p>

                    <p>I intend to take off my career in Mobile App and Web Development by landing an internship with Microsoft.
                        The story of how the company started motivates me. I look forward to a future where my technology will be used
                        to help everyone achieve their own career goals. I have a very clear picture of my destination in the next
                        10 years and that keeps me motivated."</blockquote></p>
