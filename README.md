# YensoGram

The default branch holds my best work so far. It was created as result of a requirement to complete [Harvard University's CS50 Final Project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/project/).
Other branches hold projects I created and with their respective README files.

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

YensoGram is basically a blog web application that allows a user to make posts and send messages in form of chats to other users. It was developed using Python (Flask), SQL, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

A new user signs up for an account with an email, username and password. When signed up, the user logs in using his/her details. Intially, the user
has no friends and thus no posts to be seen. The application allows the user to find other users and add them as friends. When the user makes a post,
it will be visible to other users who are friends with him/her and vice versa. The user can also send messages to other users
who are friends with him. YensoGram also allows the abilty to update and delete posts made by the user.
