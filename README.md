# Final Project

My default branch is where my best work so far lives on. It was created as result of a requirement to complete Harvard University's CS50 course.
Other branches hold my other projects.

-----------------------PROJECT DESCRIPTION--------------------------------------

YensoGram is basically a blog web application with messaging features. It was developed using Python (Flask), SQL, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

A new user signs up for an account with an email, username and password. When signed up, the user logs in using his/her details. Intially, the user
has no friends and thus no posts to be seen. The application allows the user to find other users and add them as friends. When the user makes a post,
it will be visible to other users who are friends with him/her and vice versa. The user can also send messages in the form of chats to other users
who are friends with him. YensoGram also allows the abilty to update and delete posts made by the user.
