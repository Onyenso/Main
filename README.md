# cs50-projects
Random projects I did for Harvard University's CS50 course.

The default branch holds the project I consider the best in **this repository**. Other branches hold **entirely different projects** I also created and as such,
their file structures are different from the default branch. In essence, you cannot navigate directly to a branch from a subdirectory in another branch because the URLs will not match. The other branches may or may not have their respective `README.md` files that tells what each project is about as at the time you're reading this. They will be updated
in due time.

**This `README.md` file is not complete yet.**
